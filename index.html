      <p>BusMall is a startup company looking to publish a catalog of assorted high-markup products.  These catalogs will be placed in Puget Sound regional transit system buses for passengers to have as a mental escape from the long travel times.  BusMall would like you to participate in a market analysis by helping them understand which items to feature in their catalog.</p>
      <p>Please click on one product from the three displayed images that you would most likely purchase.  Three new images will appear after each selection and will repeat a total of 25 selections.  You can participate more than once by simply refreshing the page.</p>
